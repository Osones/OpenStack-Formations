# Using OpenStack

### Principle

- All the features are available through the API
- Clients (including Horizon) go through the API
- Credentials are required
  - API OpenStack: user + password + project (tenant) + domain
  - API AWS: access key ID + secret access key

### OpenStack APIs

- One API per OpenStack service
- Each API is versioned, backwards compatiblity is guaranteed
- Body of requests and responses is formatted with JSON (XML used to be supported as well)
- REST architecture
- <https://developer.openstack.org/#api>
- Some services are also available through a different API, compatible with AWS

### API access

- Direct, using HTTP, with tools like curl
- With a library
  - Official implementations in Python
  - OpenStackSDK
  - Other implementations, including for other languages (example: jclouds)
  - Shade (Python library which includes business logic)
- With official command line tools
- With Horizon
- Through higher-level third-party tools (example: Terraform)

### Official clients

- The project provides official clients: python-PROJECTclient
- Python libraries
- CLI tools
  - Authentication is done by passing credentials as parameters or environment variables
  - The `--debug` parameter shows the HTTP connection

### OpenStack Client

- Unified CLI client
- *openstack \<resource \>\<action \>* commands
- Or interactive shell
- Aims at replacing specific clients eventually
- Provides a more homogeneous user experience
- `clouds.yaml` configuration file

<https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/configuration/index.html#clouds-yaml>

## Keystone: Authentication, authorization and service catalog

### Principles

- Users and groups directory
- Manages domains
- Lists projects (tenants)
- Service catalog
- Manages authentication and authorization
- Provides a token to the user

### Authentication and service catalog

- Once authenticated, retrieval of a *token*
- Retrieval of the service catalog
- For each service, an HTTP endpoint (API)

### API

- API v2 (deprecated): admin port 35357, user port 5000
- API v3: port 5000
- Manages *users*, *groups*, *domains*
- Users have *roles* on *projects* (tenants)
- *Services* from the catalog are associated to *endpoints*

### Typical usage scenario

![Interactions with Keystone](images/keystone-scenario.png)

## Nova: Compute

### Principles

- Mainly manages **instances**
- Instances are created from images provided by Glance
- Instances' network interfaces are associated with Neutron ports
- Block storage can be provided to instances by Cinder

### Instance properties

- Ephemeral, a priori not HA
- Defined by a flavor
- Built from an image
- Optional: volume attachments
- Optional: boot from volume
- Optional: public SSH key
- Optional: network ports

### API

Manages:

- Instances
- Flavors
- Keypairs
- Indirectly: images, security groups, floating IPs

### Actions on instances

- Reboot / shutdown
- Snapshot
- Logs
- VNC access
- Resize
- Migration (admin)

## Glance: Image registry

### Principles

- Image (and snapshot) registry
- Image properties
- Is used by Nova to start instances

### API

- API v2: current
- API artifacts: future

### Image types

Glance supports a wide range of image types, limited by Nova's underlying technology support

- raw
- qcow2
- ami
- vmdk
- iso

### Image properties in Glance

The user can define a number of properties among which some will be used at instance creation

- Image type
- Architecture
- Distribution
- Distribution version
- Minimum disk space
- Minimum RAM
- Public or not

## Neutron: Network

### API

The API exposes these main resources:

- Network: layer 2
- Subnet: layer 3
- Port: can be attached to an instance interface, a load-balancer, etc.
- Router
- Floating IP, security group

### Floating IPs

- In addition to *fixed IPs* which are set on instances
- *Allocation* (reservation for the project) of an IP from a *pool*
- *Association* of an allocated IP to a port (of an instance, for example)
- Not directly set on instances

### Security groups

- Similar to a firewall in front of each instane
- An instance can be associated to one or multiple security groups
- Ingress and egress access rules
- Rules per protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP) and port
- Targets an IP address, a network or another security group

### Additional features

Beyond the basic L2 and L3 networking features, Neutron may provide other services:

- Load Balancing
- Firewall: different from security groups
- VPN: to reach a private network without floating IPs
- QoS

## Cinder: Block storage

### Principles

- Provides volumes (block storage) that can be attached to instances
- Manages different volume types
- Manages volume snapshots and volume backups

### Usage

- Additional volume (and persistent storage) on an instance
- Boot from volume: OS is on the volume
- Backup to object store (Swift ou Ceph) feature

## Heat: Orchestration

### Principles

- Heat is the native OpenStack solution
- Heat provides an API to manage *stacks* from *templates*
- A Heat template follows the HOT format, based on YAML
- Alternatives external to OpenStack exist, like **Terraform**

### A Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) template

*parameters* - *resources* - *outputs*

```yaml
heat_template_version: 2013-05-23
description: Simple template to deploy a single compute instance
resources:
my_instance:
  type: OS::Nova::Server
  properties:
  key_name: my_key
  image: F18-x86_64-cfntools
  flavor: m1.small
```

### Build a template from existing resources

Multiple projects are being developed

- Flame (Cloudwatt)
- HOT builder
- Merlin
