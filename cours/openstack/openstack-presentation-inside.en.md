## Internals

### Architecture

![Detailed view of the services](images/architecture-simple.jpg)

### Implementation

- Everything is written in Python (Django for the web part)
- Each project is split in multiple services (example: API, scheduler, etc.)
- Re-use of existing components and existing libraries
- Usage of `oslo.*` libraries (developed by and for OpenStack): logs, config, etc.
- Usage of `rootwrap` to call underlying programs as root

### Implementation - dependencies

- Database: relational SQL (MySQL/MariaDB)
- Communication between services: AMQP (RabbitMQ)
- Caching: Memcached
- Distributed storage of configuration (to come): etcd

## Development model

### Stats (2017)

- Peer review for code: Gerrit
- Continous Integration (CI): Zuul
- Blueprints/specifications and bugs:
  -  Launchpad
  -  StoryBoard

### Who contributes?

- *Active Technical Contributor* (ATC)
  - Person with at least one recent contribution in a recognized OpenStack project
  - Voting rights (TC and PTL)
- *Core reviewer*: ATC with permissions to approve patches in a project
- *Project Team Lead* (PTL): elected by the ATC of each project

### Upstream Training

- 2 days training
- Learn how to become an OpenStack contributor
- Tools
- Processes
- Work and collaborate in an open way

### OpenStack Infra

- Team in charge of the OpenStack development infrastructure
- Works like the OpenStack developement teams and uses the same tools
- Result: Infrastructure as code **open source** <https://opensourceinfra.org/>
- Uses (hybrid) cloud
- Develops some tools:
  - Zuul
  - yaml2ical

### OpenStack Summit

- Every 6 months at the middle of the development cycle
- In the USA until 2013, now between North America and Asia/Europe
- A few dozens at the beginning to thousands attendees today
- At the same time: conference (users, decision makers)and Forum (developers/operators, replaces part of the previous Design Summit)
- Defines the name of the next release: place/city near the Summit

### Project Team Gathering (PTG)

- Since 2017
- At the beginning of each cycle
- Replaces part of the previous Design Summit
- Dedicated to developers

### Translation

- Official *i18n* team
- Only some parts are translated, like Horizon
- The French translation is one of the most complete today
- Use of a web platform based on Zanata: <https://translate.openstack.org/>

## DevStack: quickly run OpenStack

### DevStack use cases

- Quickly deploy OpenStack
- Used by developers to test their changes
- Used for demos
- Used to the the APIs without bothering about a deployment
- Must NOT be used for production

### DevStack internals

- Support for Ubuntu 16.04/17.04, Fedora 24/25, CentOS/RHEL 7, Debian, OpenSUSE
- A shell script is responsible for everything: stack.sh
- A config file: local.conf
- Installs all the required dependencies (packages)
- Clones all the git repositories (master branch by d√©faut)
- Launches all the components

### Configuration: local.conf

Example

```bash
[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secrete
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_TOKEN=a682f596-76f3-11e3-b3b2-e716f9080d50
#FIXED_RANGE=172.31.1.0/24
#FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.20.0/25
#HOST_IP=10.3.4.5
```

### Usage tips

- DevStack installs a lot on the machine
- It is recommended to work inside a VM
- To test all the OpenStack components in good conditions, multiple Go of RAM are necessary
- Use of Vagrant is recommended
